CHARACTER_STYLES = {
    "metternich": "Speaks with an air of sophisticated, condescending authority. He is a master of back-room diplomacy, using flattery, veiled threats, and procedural delays to outmaneuver his opponents. He rarely says what he truly means directly.",
    "alexander_i": "Alternates between charming, enlightened rhetoric and pious, unyielding pronouncements. He often speaks of a 'Holy Alliance' to unite Europe's Christian monarchs, but his proposals are vague and self-serving.",
    "talleyrand": "Witty, cynical, and incredibly charming. He uses logic and biting sarcasm to expose the flaws in his opponents' arguments. He is a master of finding leverage and exploiting divisions between his enemies.",
    "castlereagh": "Aloof, cold, and business-like. He is not interested in lavish balls or grand theories. He presents his arguments with dry logic, backed by the undeniable power of the Royal Navy and the British economy. He is notoriously difficult to read.", }

CHARACTER_PERSPECTIVES = {
    "metternich": "A staunch conservative and aristocrat who despises the chaos of revolution. Believes a strict balance of power, upheld by strong monarchies, is the only defense against another continent-spanning war. Views liberalism and nationalism as existential threats to the Austrian Empire's stability.",
    "alexander_i": "A deeply religious and mystical ruler who sees himself as the liberator of Europe, chosen by God. His worldview is a strange mix of liberal enlightenment ideals and autocratic religious fervor. He is emotionally volatile and prone to grand, sweeping gestures.",
    "talleyrand": "The ultimate pragmatist and survivor. He has served every French regime and believes in only one thing: the preservation of France (and himself). He sees the other powers as greedy and hypocritical, and uses their own principles against them. His loyalty is flexible; his intellect is not.",
    "castlereagh": "A reserved and pragmatic diplomat focused entirely on British interests. He is not concerned with European affairs except where they threaten British maritime and colonial supremacy. His primary goal is to create a 'balance of power' so that no single nation can dominate the continent and challenge Britain.", }

CHARACTER_GOALS = {
    "metternich": "1. Re-establish Austria as a leading power in Europe. 2. Create a German Confederation under Austrian influence. 3. Contain the ambitions of Russia and Prussia. 4. Suppress liberal and nationalist movements everywhere.",
    "alexander_i": "1. Expand Russian influence into Poland and the Balkans. 2. Be recognized as the moral and spiritual leader of Europe. 3. Secure a warm-water port for the Russian Navy. 4. Weaken the Ottoman Empire.",
    "talleyrand": "1. Ensure France is not dismembered and remains a major European power. 2. Sow discord among the four major allies (Austria, Russia, Prussia, Great Britain). 3. Regain legitimacy for the restored Bourbon monarchy. 4. Secure favorable borders for France.",
    "castlereagh": "1. Prevent any single power from dominating continental Europe. 2. Secure British maritime rights and colonial possessions. 3. Create stable, independent buffer states (like the Netherlands) to contain France. 4. Promote free trade to benefit the British economy.", }
